          By definition, this modality refers to the “perceptual preference
          related to the use of experience and practice.”
          Although such an experience may invoke other modalities, the key is
          that people who prefer this mode <br>are connected to reality, “either
          through concrete personal experiences, examples, practice or
          simulation”.It includes demonstrations, simulations, videos and movies of “real” things, as
          well as case studies, practice <br>and applications. The key is the
          reality or concrete nature of the example. If it can be grasped, held,
          tasted, or felt it will probably be included. People with this as a
          strong preference learn from the experience of doing something and
          they value their own background of experiences and less so, the
          experiences of others. It is possible to write or speak
          Kinesthetically if the topic is strongly based in reality. An
          assignment that requires <br>the details of who will do what and when, is
          suited to those with this preference, as is a case study or a working
          example of what is intended or proposed.Alongside the fulfilment of
          the BSc (Hons) in Computer Science programme requirements, the module
          content serves as a foundation to build a successful career in
          programming.Generally, the knowledge being gained will be useful in
          securely performing regular business activities involving information
          systems.Learning activities in this module include regular lectures,
          practical workshops, group and individual-ass,and a final exam.
          Students are sincerely advised to refer to the module handbook as
          often as required to understand the nature of the module and all the
          learning activities included to gain the most out of the module.
